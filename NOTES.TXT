PYMEX NOTES
-----------

2020/07/10
  - added Avialability class
  - modified Experiment.build() to return (id, data) tuple  
  - modified Interactor.build() to return (id, data) tuple
  - modified Interaction.build() to substitute experimentRef
    with corresponding experimentDescription. This (as well as
    substitutuions of interactorRef and availabilityRef) required     
    some of the constructors to take root dictionary as
    argument.
  - added two test files (compact & expanded) to data directory
